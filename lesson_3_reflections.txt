When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - If you are working from another computer
 - If you are stubbing out a new project
 - If you have non-technical user who need to add supporting files like images, text files, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - You may be working on changes that are not complete, if someone pushes a commit that affects your code, it could cause
   a big mess.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 - A fork is a copy of a repository on a remote (like github)
 - A clone is a local copy of a repository
 - A branch is a separate commit stream within a repository
 - I would use a fork when I need to make a copy of someone's repository that I cannot commit to directly
 - I would use a clone when I want a local workarea for a repository.  Most likely because I am actively working on the repository
 - I would use a branch when I have a set of changes that are not ready for distribution, but I would to collaborate on

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 - Having the last known state of the remote allows the local version of git the ability to reconcile merges or mark when 
   the remote and local repositories have diverged.
