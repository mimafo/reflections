When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - If you are working from another computer
 - If you are stubbing out a new project
 - If you have non-technical user who need to add supporting files like images, text files, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - You may be working on changes that are not complete, if someone pushes a commit that affects your code, it could cause
   a big mess.
