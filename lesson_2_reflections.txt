What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 - When you initialize your repository with the 'git init' command, it creates a .git directory and allows you to start
   using git for source control on your project.  You need to do it to create the framework/plumbing for git to manage
   code in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 - The staging area is fundamentally different from the working directory.  It allows you to bundle files and changes 
   together before committing them.  It is important to have a staging area to allow the user to build out a change set before
   committing.
